 * @brief Computes a 2D parameterization of a triangular mesh using
 * orthographic projection
 *
 * This class performs naive mesh parameterization using orthographic
 * projection. The largest plane of the mesh bounding box is selected as the
 * projection plane. Each vertex is orthographically projected onto this plane,
 * and the UV coordinate is calculated as the relative position of the
 * projected point within the bounds of the projection plane.
 *
 * This class is primarily only useful for meshes which are already planar
 * or semi-planar.
